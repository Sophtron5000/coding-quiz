//GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

// WHEN I click the start button, (eventListener)
    //120 sec. timer starts setTimer() (in code drills)
        //questions become visible(hidden numbered card activity)
            //if question is answered correctly (for loop + if else)
                //present next question
                //else subtract time from the clock
   //when timer runs out game over || all answers true (end of function or timer?)
    //else log in local storage score(time left) + initials (formSubmission activity)

//GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

// WHEN I click the start button, 
    //120 sec. timer starts setTimer() (in code drills)
        //questions become visible
            //if question is answered correctly
                //present next question
                //else subtract time from the clock
   //when timer runs out game over || all answers true
    //else log in local storage score(time left) + initials
